<br>Hi! I’m Chen, a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.tii.ae/">Technology Innovation Institute</a>, working on large language models, natural language processing, and information retrieval. 
Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/">Weizmann Institute of Science </a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~robi/">Prof. Robert Krauthgamer</a> and <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/Nadler/home"> Prof. Boaz Nadler</a>.
During my Ph.D., I interned at <a href="https://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a> and <a href="https://khealth.com/">K Health</a>, where I got to apply my research to personalized travel and healthcare chatbots.<br><br>
These days, I’m especially interested in how we can get Gen-AI systems to provide more reliable, useful, and accessible information.
<br><br>
<i>I’m always happy to talk about research, feel free to <a href="mailto:chenamiraz@gmail.com">reach out!</a></i>

<b>Updates:</b><br><br>

<ul style="height: 300px; overflow: auto">
	<li><i>July 2025:</i> New preprint on <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2507.07543">arXiv</a>! We show how language bias in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can arise from cross-lingual retrieval issues and suggest simple ways to reduce it.
	</li><br>
	
	<li><i>May 2025:</i> Our paper on quantifying the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06914">distracting effect</a> of irrelevant passages on LLMs has been accepted for oral presentation at <a href="https://2025.aclweb.org/">ACL 2025</a>. See you in Vienna!
	</li><br>

	<li><i>July 2024:</i> I joined <a href="https://www.tii.ae/">TII</a> as a Research Scientist! I'm working
		on the intersection of artifical intelligence and search in the AI/IR research center led by <a href="https://www.yoelle.com/">Yoelle Maarek</a>.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>May 2024:</i> I defended my PhD! You can find my thesis on the
		<a href="/publications">publications</a> page.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>January 2024:</i> Our paper on <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/amiraz24a.html">efficient methods for sparse learning in distributed settings</a> has been accepted to <a href="https://aistats.org/aistats2024/">AISTATS 2024</a> in Spain!
	</li><br>

	<li><i>September 2023:</i> I started an internship at <a href="https://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a> as a Machine Learning Scientist, working on personalization within Gen-AI chatbots for travel planning.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>August 2023:</i> I received the Yoel Meches Memorial Fellowship, also awarded by KKL-JNF.</li><br>


	<li><i>August 2022:</i> I've been awarded the Moshe Meir Horovitz Memorial Fellowship by KKL-JNF.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>March 2022:</i> I had a great time speaking at <a href="https://2022.widstlv.com/chen-amiraz/">WiDS Tel Aviv</a>! In my talk, <i>"How a thousand little failures can turn into success"</i>, I discussed how, even when each individual device contributes only limited and noisy information, we can still learn from distributed data. The recording is available <a href="https://youtu.be/AA1HXm6SYno?si=Sooon7gKshFgDZTl">here</a>.</li><br>
